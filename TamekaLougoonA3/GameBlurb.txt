Well, it seems that there's nothing I can do for you. That run in with the witch you had last week really did a number on you. It appears that she attempted to steal 
your life force and store it in that crystal you told me about, but she didn't quite succeed. 

Your only hope is to find her and retrieve the crystal before it's too late! 

Caverton Realm is vast and we have no way of tracking her, so it's up to you to find her. 

Your travels will not be easy...

For your journey, I present you with the Soulsiphon staff. It is a powerful weapon but can only work from a distance, so be careful not to get too close or you will have a 
nasty witch on your hands with nothing to defend yourself. Unfortunately, it is an ancient artifact so I can't guarantee its stability. I would suggest only using it 
the recommended number of times, or the magic it's infused with may become unstable and attack you instead. 

With each turn, you may move to an adjacent land, using one of the listed possible routes via a portal (be wary; you are already weak, your body will only be able to handle 
a portal so many times) or call upon the power of the staff (shoot direction) hopefully hitting the witch and killing her! 
If you miss, you could be in trouble...

When you enter a new area, if you are one land away from the Witch or another hazard, you will be given a warning about what is in one (or more) of the lands 
leading from your current location. However, you won't be told which direction in which it lies.

QUICKSAND lays throughout the lands, appearing in large pits which are near impossible to escape. It said that if you fall in  deep enough, you'll fall all the way
through to another land. 
Be aware of your surroundings and watch your step!

CORRUPTED CRYPTS hold the dead that were unable to find peace in the afterlife. They lay there, restless and growing more agitated with each day that passes, until an 
unsuspecting traveler wanders into their clutches and joins their ranks. 
Don't be their next victim.

THE WITCH is a terrible woman who has been terrorizing the lands for centuries. She is the most powerful woman known to man, so if she sees you, your fate is certain. 
With her power, nothing can stand in her way, so she roams the lands freely.
